Being a university student involves a high degree of autonomy and responsibility when it comes to learning. Students are expected to independently structure their learning, use appropriate learning strategies, set learning goals, monitor and evaluate learning outcomes, and maintain motivation to learn—even in the face of difficulties. In other words, students are expected to be \*self-regulated\* and \*motivated learners\*. 

The focus of this website is to provide students with direct access to information and tools that can help support their self-regulated learning and motivation regulation in an easy-to-understand manner. Moreover, various materials are also provided for teachers and school counsellors to foster knowledge on supporting students’ study habits and strategies to overcome learning and motivation problems.
