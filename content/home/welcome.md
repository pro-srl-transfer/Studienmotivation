<p align="justify"><font size = 3><div class="adjust-line-height">Being a university student involves a high degree of <b>autonomy</b> and <b>responsibility</b> when it comes to <b>learning</b>. Students are expected to <b>independently structure their learning, use appropriate learning strategies, set learning goals, monitor and evaluate learning outcomes, and maintain motivation to learn</b>—even in the face of difficulties. In other words, students are expected to be <b>self-regulated</b> and  <b>motivated</b> learners. The focus of this website is to provide students with access to information and tools that can help improve their self-regulated learning and motivation regulation. Various materials are also provided for teachers to support their students’ study habits and strategies to overcome learning and motivation problems.</div>
