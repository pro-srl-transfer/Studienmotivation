Being a university student involves a high degree of autonomy and responsibility when it comes to learning. Students are expected to independently structure their learning, use appropriate learning strategies, set learning goals, monitor and evaluate learning outcomes, and maintain motivation to learn—even in the face of difficulties. In other words, students are expected to be*self-regulated* and *motivated* learners. The focus of this website is to provide students with access to information and tools that can help improve their self-regulated learning and motivation regulation. Various materials are also provided for teachers to support their students’ study habits and strategies to overcome learning and motivation problems.
